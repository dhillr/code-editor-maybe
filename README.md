# code editor
this was actually not an assigment

i just wanted to make coding easier
for people with a chromebook

and because you can run python
stuff on a chromebook using the
linux terminal...

# how to setup on chromebook
download this and go to the files app thingy

if you don't have linux enabled already,
go to settings and search *"linux"*
and click *"Set up"* and wait

if you do already have it enabled, go to the file you
just downloaded and

go inside the zip and drag the folder in there to the downloads folder

and then right click that folder and press *"Share with Linux"*

now in the linux terminal *(access it by going into the ***terminal*** app)*
copy these commands:

```bash
cd ../../mnt/chromeos/MyFiles/Downloads
cd code-editor-maybe-master # or whatever you have it named
python3 editor.py
```
> [!WARNING]
> this will **NOT** work if you don't share your file with linux

and you just ran the editor!!!!1!1!11!11!
